# A Visual Aid for the Cryptanalysis of Running Key Ciphers

  

## About

  
  

The **Running Key Cipher** is a polyalphabetic substitution cipher in which ciphertext is generated by encrypting plaintext with an equally long keystream in the same manner that a Vigenere cipher is encrypted.

  

The tool may be used through the following link: [https://ethan-gil.github.io/RunningKeyTool/](https://ethan-gil.github.io/RunningKeyTool/)

This software was designed for **CSC 438 - Cryptology** by Ethan Gil. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me at ethan.gil1@outlook.com.
  
  

## Prerequisites

  

In order to properly use this tool, it's highly recommended that you are familiar with the Vigenere Cipher and Running Key Cipher, along with methods for cryptanalyzing both.

  
  

## Instructions

  

Using this visual aid is relatively simple, and to do so you only need a string of ciphertext and an optional crib - which is a string believed to be in the plaintext. Upon pasting the ciphertext and crib into the correct textboxes, and then press the Cryptanalyze button.

  

A table will be created with three rows - ciphertext, plaintext, and the key.

  

You may notice that the crib will automatically be entered, along with the the corresponding key values. Due to the nature of this cipher, it's important to be able to shift the plaintext and keystream left and right, while maintaining a static ciphertext position.

  

Thus, with each shift, a new keystream will be generated based on the cipertext and plaintext values. The ciperhtext and plaintext values will not change through shifts though, and the plaintext may only be changed through manual input.

  

You may click on any cells within the table and enter in a letter that you believe belongs there. This may be done for both the plaintext and key cells, but it's worth noting that if you attempt to change a letter that will affect the crib, a warning prompt will display.

  
## Example
Consider the ciphertext shown below. Also, assume that the word "kentucky" may be involved in the plaintext.

First, the ciperhtext and crib are inputted, and the cryptanalyze button is pressed. We may see that the crib is inputted, along with a potential fragment of the key. It does not look like English though, so it's safe to assume that the plaintext is not in the correct position.

Thus, we may shift to the right until we see anything that looks like English. After several right shifts, it looks as though certain fragments of words have been found. Specifically, it looks as though the words "end" and "in" are in the key.

Next, we may begin guessing letters. The letters "lov" in the key may be "lovers", so we may guess that. Now, we see that the word "university" could possibly be in the plaintext, so we may enter that.

It looks as though that last guess was correct, and we have now have filled in the right-most cells of the plaintext and key. Since we have the majority of the plaintext, and we know that it's a university in kentucky, we may use intution to guess the remaining characters.

It looks as though the plaintext is **Northern Kentucky University** and the key is **Journeys end in lovers meeting**.
